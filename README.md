Gnarly Grey UPDuino Board

Arduino has been a great tool for rapid development using microcontrollers. Complementing microcontroller development with the performance and IO capabilities of an FPGA with similar cost, power and size metrics provides the ultimate nirvana. The Gnarly Grey UPDuino Board provides this on the latest and greatest mobile FPGA from Lattice called UltraPlus. The Ultraplus FPGA is unique in that it provides the power profile of a microcontroller with the amount of block ram found in large FPGAs. This is a great board for IO expansion, data buffering, and low latency requirements typically not serviceable by a microcontroller.
